# Daily Wisdom - Quote Generator

A personal project built to explore React, TypeScript, and UI design principles. This application displays inspirational quotes and allows users to discover new wisdom with the click of a button.

## My Learning Journey

This project was an opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of:

- Building responsive UI components with React and TypeScript
- Working with state management in function components
- Implementing smooth animations and transitions
- Creating an aesthetically pleasing user experience with Tailwind CSS
- Using modern UI component libraries (shadcn/ui)

## Features

- Display random inspirational quotes from a curated collection
- Smooth transitions between quotes
- Social sharing capabilities (Twitter, WhatsApp)
- Copy quotes to clipboard functionality
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Shadcn/ui component library

## What I Learned

Through building this project, I gained valuable experience in:

1. **Component Architecture**: Creating reusable, modular components that work together seamlessly
2. **State Management**: Using React's useState and useCallback hooks effectively
3. **Animations**: Implementing smooth transitions between content changes
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application works well on devices of all sizes

## Future Improvements

As I continue to develop my skills, I plan to enhance this project by:

- Adding user accounts to save favorite quotes
- Implementing a quote search feature
- Creating categories for different types of quotes
- Adding dark mode support

## Running the Project
